        Parameters
        ----------
            normalization_function : callable
                Function which should be used to normalize `matrix` columns. It should match signature `foo(x, cost)`,
                where `x` is a vector which should be normalized and `cost` is a bool variable which says if `x` is a
                cost or profit criterion.

        Parameters
        ----------
            matrix : ndarray
                Decision matrix / alternatives data.
                Alternatives are in rows and Criteria are in columns.

            weights : ndarray
                Criteria weights. Sum of the weights should be 1. (e.g. sum(weights) == 1)

            types : ndarray
                Array with definitions of criteria types:
                1 if criteria is profit and -1 if criteria is cost for each criteria in `matrix`.

            *args and **kwargs are necessary for methods which reqiure some additional data.

        Returns
        -------
            ndarray
                Preference values for alternatives. Better alternatives have higher values.
