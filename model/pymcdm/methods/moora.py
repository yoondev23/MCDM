Parameters
----------
    matrix : ndarray
        Decision matrix / alternatives data.
        Alternatives are in rows and Criteria are in columns.

    weights : ndarray
        Criteria weights. Sum of the weights should be 1. (e.g. sum(weights) == 1)

    types : ndarray
        Array with definitions of criteria types:
        1 if criteria is profit and -1 if criteria is cost for each criteria in `matrix`.

    *args and **kwargs are necessary for methods which reqiure some additional data.

Returns
-------
    ndarray
        Preference values for alternatives. Better alternatives have higher values.
